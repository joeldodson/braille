# Hable One

- a list of stuff
- another entry in the list 
- and a third entry
{aria-label="label for this experimental list"}

The [Hable One ](https://iamhable.com)
is a braille input device to operate an iOS or Android mobile device.
It has 8 input keys, the standard 1 through 6 dots plus dots 7 and 8.
The keys are used for typing using braille input, and to control the mobile device.
It works great with both VoiceOver on iOS and TalkBack on Android.
Watch the [Shaun of the Shed video, Control your iPhone without touching it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udrLSvPNxQY) for a quick introduction.

This page contains all the commands common to both platforms as well as commands specific to iOS and Android.
Follow the heading structure and read any notes for the section,
or jump directly to tables if you already know what you're looking for.

If you find something doesn't work as documented, or you think something is missing, or you have suggestions for clarification,
please [email blindgumption@gmail.com](mailto:blindgumption@gmail.com). 
 
 ## Hable's Documentation

You can access [manuals for the Hable One online](https://www.iamhable.com/en-am/pages/manuals).
And when you're getting started, it's a good idea to read through those.
The manuals contain descriptions and initializing information not presented here.
This reference is taken mostly from the manuals with some notes based on my experiences.
I've also gone through the playlists from the [Hable One YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@hableone) and provided some summaries.
Some videos have information already presented in the manuals, which I don't call out as the reference is already documented.

It's a good idea to go through the play lists at least once when learning the Hable One.
You can find them easily on your own, I don't provide any links in here to specific videos.
This site is intended to be browsed quickly to look for information you might have forgotten or missed earlier, I don't want to add link clutter.

## Commands Common to Android and iOS

This section contains commands used for both iOS and Android devices.
These include commands to configure the Hable One itself
(e.g., change the language, switch between Android and iOS),
as well as generic commands consistent across both platforms.

I've gone through both the Android and iOS beginners guides to create these tables.
The headings below were inspired by the structure of those docs, with some changes.
Hopefully it makes sense as you read through them.
Some commands could arguably be in a different category, and some I've decided to list in multiple categories.
Maybe you'll agree with my logic, maybe not.
Hopefully you'll agree at least there are some grey areas.

Also, as of July 2025, I have very little Android experience.
And, to be honest, not much depth with the Hable One yet either.
I suspect as I do get more experience in general, the groupings below will change.
If you're looking for a specific action, it's probably best to try text searching and not worry too much where it is on the page.

### Note on Android or iOS

No, not a which one is better.
My goal is to keep all opinions out of braille.codes, though sometimes the temptation is too much (especially regarding Siri).
The point I want to make here is Android and iOS are solving similar problems,
thus there are ideas consistent across both platforms.
This applies to TalkBack and VoiceOver as well.
A feature on iOS, e.g., rotor, might have a similar feature on Android.
They might have different names and slightly different functionality.
At their core though, they solve the same problem thus can be accessed using the same commands.

If you read through both the Android and iOS manuals from Hable, you'll notice many codes are repeated.
Hable has done a great job using the same codes for the same functionality,
e.g., navigating around text, going to the home screen.
Making it much easier to switch between an Android and iOS device.

### Hable Menu: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

The following commands are for configuring the Hable One, or checking status.
You need to be in the Hable menu before using any of these commands.
Hold down all keys 1 through 6 until your device buzzes 4 times,
then hold down the desired command, until the buzz.
After you enter the command, the Hable exits the menu.
If you want to enter another menu command, you must first hold down the 1 through 6 keys again.
The Hable menu commands table contains only the keys for the command, not the 1 through 6 to enter the menu.
Remember you need to be in the Hable menu for these commands to work.

### Mobile Device Navigation

As noted above, moving around an Android or iOS device has a lot in common.
They might use different terms in some cases, but the ideas are the same.
For example, there's a home screen and a list of running applications,
and there's a need to go to the next and previous items,
maybe those items are controls within an app, or icons of apps on the screen.

The table below are the commands used in both Android and iOS modes to navigate the device,
including selecting/activating the item currently in focus.

```{list-table} Commands to navigate the mobile device
:header-rows: 1
:stub-columns: 1

* - Action
  - Command
  - Notes

* - go to home screen
  - hold keys 1, 2, 5
  - same as letter h 

* - Recent Apps / App Switcher
  - hold 2, 3
  - if not working, try going to home screen first

* - Move to next item
  - hold 7, press 8
  - go to next app on the screen or next item within an app (single finger swipe right)

* - Move to previous item
  - hold 8, press 7
  - go to previous app on the screen or previous item within an app (single finger swipe left)

* - Select/activate item
  - press 7, 8
  - select/activate item with focus (single finger double tap)

* - Go to top of screen
  - hold keys 1, 2, 3
  - Go to first clickable item on screen. If not working on iOS, enable quick navigation (see iOS section below).

* - Go to bottom of screen
  - hold keys 4, 5, 6
  - Go to last clickable item on screen. If not working on iOS, enable quick navigation (see iOS section below).

* - Back
  - hold keys 1, 2
  - documented as going to previous page but seems to work in various other context (e.g., in iOS, escapes out of VoiceOver help, like the two finger scrub). Remember it is there and try it when you want to go back in some sense.
* - Notifications
  - hold 1, 3, 4, 5
  - Same as letter 'n', as in notification

* - Control Center
  - hold 2, 4, 5
  - Same as letter 'j', not sure why, 'c' was taken?

* - Status Bar 
  - hold 2, 3, 4
  - Same as letter 's', as in status
```

### Controlling the Mobile Device

This loosely maps to Shortcuts in the Hable One docs.
I think controlling is more descriptive than shortcuts.
In here are commands for actions like adjusting the volume and muting the screen reader.

```{list-table} Commands to control the mobile device
:header-rows: 1
:stub-columns: 1

* - Action
  - Command
  - Notes

* - Mute the screen reader
  - hold 1, 3, 4
  - same as letter 'm', as in mute

* - Volume Down
  - hold 1, 2, 6
  - 

* - Volume Up
  - Android: hold 2, 3, 5, iOS: hold: 3, 4, 5
  - need to test if these are really different

* - Pause Reading
  - hold 1
  - hold 1 again to resume reading

* - Read from top
  - hold 2, 4, 5, 6
  - note the pattern similarity with read from current position

* - Read from current position
  - hold 1, 2, 3, 5
  - note the pattern similarity with read from top

* - Play/Pause Media
  - hold 1, 2, 3, 4
  - 

* - Two Finger Double Tap
  - hold 3
  - so many uses, e.g., answer call, start/stop audio playing

* - Long Press Item
  - hold 3, 8
  - 

* - Lock Screen
  - hold 2, 5
  - 

* - Screen Curtain
  - hold 3, 4
  - 

* - Screen Shot
  - hold 3, 6
  - take a picture of your screen 

* - Search Screen
  - hold 1, 2, 4
  - 

* - Activate Assistant
  - hold 1, 4, 5
  - Google Assistant (for something helpful) or Siri (for everything else)

* - Print
  - hold 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
  - need to test
```

### Navigating a Document or Application

These are commands to move around a document.
For example, while reading a web page or editing a text file.
Actually editing the file is the next section.

When documenting the action to close a tab, I thought maybe there should be a navigating an application table as well.
I decided that was starting to slice too thin.
Instead I'll expand the idea of a document to include  navigating apps.

```{list-table} Commands to navigate a document or application
:header-rows: 1
:stub-columns: 1

* - Action
  - Command
  - Notes

* - Move to next character
  - hold 7, press 4
  - move past the character to the right of the cursr and speak the character

* - Move to previous character
  - hold 4, press 7
  - move past the character to the left of the cursr and speak the character

* - Skip next word
  - hold 7, press 5
  - move past the word to the right of the cursr and speak the word.  Cursor is now immediately following last character in the word.

* - Skip previous word
  - hold 5, press 7
  - move past the word to the left of the cursr and speak the word. Cursor is now immediately before first character in the word.

* - Search in document
  - hold 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
  - hold 2, 6 to scroll search results

* - Scroll Search Results
  - hold 2, 6
  - documented in search document, not sure if applicable in other search results

* - New
  - hold 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
  - Hable docs just say "new" for Android but suggest iOS apps where this will create a newe Note, or email or other stuff.  Maybe just know this exists and try it when you want to create a new of something.

* - New Tab
  - hold 2, 5, 6
  - documented specifically for browsers, maybe it applies to other tab based apps?

* - Close Tab
  - hold 2, 3, 5
  - documented specifically for browsers, maybe it applies to other tab based apps?

```

### Editing a Document

First, a quick note on typing the contents of your document.
Once you're in an editable document/field, you enter text using the keys using the braille codes.
Those codes are on the [tables of braille codes page](tables.md).
The page also has explanations of how to generate capital letters, words, and sentences, how to type digits, and a fairly complete list of punctuation.
None of that is repeated in this section.
Here we will focus on topics like highlighting, copy/cut and paste, and deleting.

```{list-table} Commands to edit a document
:header-rows: 1
:stub-columns: 1

* - Action
  - Command
  - Notes

* - Use contractions
  - hold 1, 2, 4, 5
  - 2 buzzes is entering contractions mode, 1 buzz is leaving it.  See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) regarding contractions.

* - Dictation
  - hold 2
  - hold until buzz, release and speak, hold 2 again to end dictation 

* - Enter
  - press 1, 8
  - In some contexts, this will send a message (e.g., whatsapp).  See below for shift-enter for a newline in a message

* - Shift Enter / New Line
  - press 2, 8
  - For example, add a new line in messages without sending the message

* - Space
  - press 8
  - inserts a space character (no pins I guess)

* - Backspace
  - press 7
  - this deletes the character immediately left of the cursor.  To move back a character without deleting,see navigating a document.

* - Undo
  - hold 1, 3, 5, 6
  -

  - works on highlighted text

```

## Android Commands

Following are commands specific to Android.
Some of these might have analogues to iOS commands, with different terminology
(e.g., reading line setting vs VoiceOver rotor).
I've chosen to include them here thinking people might look for Android specific terminology.

```{list-table} Commands to navigate Android
:header-rows: 1
:stub-columns: 1

* - Action
  - Command
  - Notes

* - Talkback Menu
  - hold 2, 4
  - 

* - Next Reading Line Setting
  - hold 7, press 5, 6
  - note similar pattern to previous reading line setting

* - Previous Reading Line Setting
  - hold 5, 6, press 7
  - note simlar pattern to next reading line setting

* - Next Item in Reading Line
  - hold 7, press 6
  - note similar patter to previous item in reading line 

* - Previous Item in Reading Line
  - hold 6, press 7
  - note similar pattern to next item in reading line

* - Page Up
  - hold 2, 3, 6
  - 

* - Page Down
  - hold 3, 5, 6
  - 

* - Line Begin
  - hold 1, 4, 5, 6
  - similar to line end

  - hold 3, 4, 5, 6 
  - similar to line begin

```

## iOS

Below are commands used to control an iOS based device.

```{list-table} Commands to navigate iOS
:header-rows: 1
:stub-columns: 1

* - Action
  - Command
  - Notes

* - VoiceOver Help
  - hold 1, 3
  - this is the four finger double tap.  It puts you into a state to try gestures and VO will tell you what they will do (without performing the action). This is also a great way to practice using the Hable. Go into help and try various Hable inputs.

* - Toggle Quick Navigation
  - hold 3, 4, 6
  - you'll hear an upbeat sounding tone when quick nav is enabled. It's probably best to keep quick nav enabled.  I've run into places (e.g., holding 1, 2, 3 or 4, 5, 6 to move to top or bottom of screen) that do not work if quick nav is not enabled.

* - Next Rotor Setting
  - hold 7, press 5, 6
  - note similar pattern to previous rotorsetting

* - Previous Rotor Setting
  - hold 5, 6, press 7
  - note simlar pattern to next rotor setting

* - Next Item using rotor Setting
  - hold 7, press 6
  - note similar patter to previous item using rotor setting

* - Previous Item using Rotor Setting
  - hold 6, press 7
  - note similar pattern to next item using rotor setting

* - Single Finger Swipe Down
  - hold 7, press 6
  - 

* - Single Finger Swipe Up
  - hold 6, press 7
  - 

* - Copy Speech to Clipboard

  - if not working, enable Quick Nav (hold 3, 4, 6)

* - Scroll Page Up
  - hold 3, 4, 5, 6
  - if not working, enable Quick Nav (hold 3, 4, 6)

* - Spotlight Search
  - hold 1, 6
  - global search

* - Switch Keyboard
  - hold 1, 5, 6
  - for mobile device keyboards. does not work for me, maybe I don't have any keyboards to switch to.

* - Turn Off VoiceOver
  - hold 1, 2, 3, 8
  - does not work for me. A comment in the Hable doc says use full keyboard access and hold 1, 3, 6. that seems to work, but full keyboard access conflicts with VoiceOver. 

* - Tab backward
  - hold 1, 2, 5, 6
  - probly most/only useful within a browser navigating through elements with non zero tabstop

* - Tab Forward
  - hold 2, 3, 4, 5
  - probly most/only useful within a browser navigating through elements with non zero tabstop
```
 
## Troubleshooting

### I'm typing single letters but sometimes get complete words or multiple letters

You are almost certainly in contractions mode.
Hold down the keys 1, 2, 4, 5.
If you feel a single buzz, you have gone from contracted mode back to single letter (grade 1) mode.
Try typing again and see if that fixed the problem.

If you feel two buzzes, you have gone into contracted mode and I have no idea what the initial problem was.

### The commands simply don't match this reference, including typing simple characters

You might have accidently swapped the braille dots/keys.
That is, you were in the Hable menu (held down 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) then held down 1,3,4, 6.
It seems unlikely to have done that accidently, but when you're messing around trying to learn, it can happen.
The command to swap braille keys/dots is a toggle.
Try the above again and see if it's better.

You can check the braille key/dot settings by pressing the 1 key in a text editing field.
If you get an 'a', the dots/keys are in standard configuration.
If you don't get an 'a', they are probably swapped.
Try pressing the 3 key.
If that results in an 'a', cells are swapped.

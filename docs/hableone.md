 ## Troubleshooting

 ### I'm typing single letters but sometimes get complete words or multiple letters

 You are almost certainly in contractions mode.
 Hold down the keys 1, 2, 4, 5.
 If you feel a single buzz, you have gone from contracted mode back to single letter (grade 1) mode.
 If you feel two buzzes, you have gone into contracted mode and I have no idea what the initial problem was.

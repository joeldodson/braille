# Hable One

The [Hable One ](https://iamhable.com)
is a braille input device to operate an iOS or Android mobile device.
It has 8 input keys, the standard 1 through 6 dots plus dots 7 and 8.
The keys are used not only for typing using braille input, but to control the mobile device as well.
It works great with both VoiceOver on iOS and TalkBack on Android.
Watch the [Shaun of the Shed video, Control your iPhone without touching it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udrLSvPNxQY) for a quick introduction.

This page contains all the commands common to both platforms as well as commands specific to iOS and Android.
Follow the heading structure and read any notes for the section,
or jump directly to tables if you already know what you're looking for.

If you find something doesn't work as documented, or you think something is missing, or you have suggestions for clarification,

 ## Hable's Documentation

 You can access [manuals for the Hable One online](https://www.iamhable.com/en-am/pages/manuals).
 And when you're getting started, it's a good idea to read through those.
 The manuals contain descriptions and initializing information not presented here.
 This reference is taken mostly from the manuals with some notes based on my experiences.
 I've also gone through the playlists from the [Hable One YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@hableone) and provided some summaries.
 Some videos have information already presented in the manuals, which I don't call out as the reference is already documented.
 It's a good idea to go through the play lists at least once when learning the Hable One.
 I don't provide any links in here to specific videos.
 This site is intended to be browsed quickly to look for information you might have forgotten or missed earlier, I don't want to add link clutter.

## Common Commands

This section contains commands used for both iOS and Android devices.
These include commands to configure the Hable One itself
(e.g., change the language, switch between Android and iOS),
as well as generic commands consistent across both platforms.

I've gone through both the Android and iOS beginners guides to create these tables.
The headings below were inspired by the structure of those docs, but I've made changes.
Hopefully it makes sense as you read through them.
Some commands could arguably be shortcuts vs navigation, for example, or vice versa.
Maybe you'll agree with my logic, maybe not.
Hopefully you'll agree at least there are some grey areas.

Also, as of July 2025, I have very little Android experience.
And, to be honest, not much depth with the Hable One yet either.
I suspect as I do get more experience in general, the groupings below will change.
If you're looking for a specific action, it probably best to try text searching and not worry too much where it is on the page.

### Note on Android or iOS

No, not a which one is better.
My goal is to keep all opinions out of braille.codes, though sometimes the temptation is too much.
The point I want to make here is Android and iOS are solving similar problems,
thus there are ideas consistent across both platforms.
This applies to TalkBack and VoiceOver as well.
A feature on iOS, e.g., rotor, might have a similar feature on Android.
They might have different names and slightly different functionality.
At their core though, they solve the same problem thus can be accessed using the same commands.

If you read through both the Android and iOS manuals from Hable, you'll notice many codes are repeated.
Hable has done a great job using the same codes for the same functionality,
e.g., navigating around text, going to the home screen.
 Making it much easier to switch between an Android and iOS device.
 
 ### Hable Menu: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

The following commands are for configuring the Hable One, or checking status.
You need to be in the Hable menu before using any of these commands.
Hold down all keys 1 through 6 until your device buzzes 4 times,
then hold down the desired command, until the buzz.
After you enter the command, the Hable exits the menu.
If you want to enter another menu command, you must first hold down the 1 through 6 keys again.
The Hable menu commands table contains only the keys for the command, not the 1 through 6 to enter the menu.
Remember you need to be in the Hable menu for these commands to work.

```{list-table} commands in the Hable Menu
:header-rows: 1
:stub-columns: 1

* - command

### Mobile Device Navigation

As noted above, moving around an Android or iOS device has a lot in common.
They might use different terms in some cases, but the ideas are the same.
For example, there's a home screen and a list of running applications,
and there's a need to go to the next and previous items,
maybe those items are controls within an app, or icons of apps on the screen.

The table below are the commands used in both Android and iOS modes to navigate the device,
including selecting/activating the item currently in focus.

```{list-table} Commands to navigate the mobile device
:header-rows: 1
:stub-columns: 1

* - Action
  - Keys
  - Notes

* - go to home screen
  - hold keys 1, 2, 5
  - same as letter h 

* - Move to next item
  - hold 7, press 8
  - go to next app on the screen or next item within an app (single finger swipe right)

* - Move to previous item
  - hold 8, press 7
  - go to previous app on the screen or previous item within an app (single finger swipe left)

* - Select/activate item
  - press 7, 8
  - select/activate item with focus (single finger double tap)

* - Go to top of screen
  - hold keys 1, 2, 3
  - Go to first clickable item on screen

* - Go to bottom of screen
  - hold keys 4, 5, 6
  - Go to last clickable item on screen

* - Back
  - hold keys 1, 2
  - documented as going to previous page but seems to work in various other context (e.g., in iOS, escapes out of VoiceOver help, like the two finger scrub). Remember it is there and try it when you want to go back in some sense.
* - Notifications
  - hold 1, 3, 4, 5
  - Same as letter 'n', as in notification

* - Control Center
  - hold 2, 4, 5
  - Same as letter 'j', not sure why, 'c' was taken?

* - Status Bar 
  - hold 2, 3, 4
  - Same as letter 's', as in status
```

### Controlling Mobile Device

This loosely maps to Shortcuts in the Hable One docs.
I think controlling is more descriptive than shortcuts.
In here are commands for actions like adjusting the volume and muting the screen reader.

```{list-table} Commands to control the mobile device
:header-rows: 1
:stub-columns: 1

* - Action
  - Keys
  - Notes

* - Mute the screen reader
  - hold 1, 3, 4
  - 

* - Screen Curtain
  - hold 3, 4
  - 

* - Activate Assistant
  - hold 1, 4, 5
  - Google Assistant (for something helpful) or Siri (for everything else)
```

### Navigating a Document

These are commands to move around a document.
For example, while reading a web page or editing a text file.
Actually editing the file is the next section.

```{list-table} Commands to navigate a document
:header-rows: 1
:stub-columns: 1

* - Action
  - Keys
  - Notes

* - placeholder
  - placeholder
  - no notes
```

### Editing a Document

First, a quick note on typing the contents of your document.
Once you're in an editable document/field, you enter text using the keys using the braille codes.
Those codes are on the [tables of braille codes page](tabless.md).
That page also has explanations of how to generate capital letters, words, and sentences, how to type digits, and a fairly complete list of punctuation.
I'm not going to repeat any of that in this section.
Here we will focus on topics like highlighting, copy/cut and paste, and deleting.

```{list-table} Commands to edit a document
:header-rows: 1
:stub-columns: 1

* - Action
  - Keys
  - Notes

* - Dictation
  - hold 2
  - Huld until buzz, release and speak, hold 2 again to end dictation 

* - Enter
  - press 1, 8
  - In some contexts, this will send a message (e.g., whatsapp).  See below for shift-enter for a newline in a message

* - Shift Enter / New Line
  - press 2, 8
  - For example, add a new line in messages without sending the message

* - Space
  - press 8
  - inserts a space character (no pins I guess)

* - Backspace
  - press 7
  - this deletes the character immediately left of the cursor.  To move back a character without deleting,see navigating a document.
```

## Android Commands

 Below are the commands used to control an Android based device.

```{list-table} Commands to navigate Android
:header-rows: 1
:stub-columns: 1

* - Action
  - Keys
  - Notes

* - placeholder
  - placeholder
  - no notes
```

 ## iOS

 Below are commands used to control an iOS based device.

```{list-table} Commands to navigate iOS

```
 
## Troubleshooting

 ### I'm typing single letters but sometimes get complete words or multiple letters

 You are almost certainly in contractions mode.
 Hold down the keys 1, 2, 4, 5.
 If you feel a single buzz, you have gone from contracted mode back to single letter (grade 1) mode.
 Try typing again and see if that fixed the problem.

 If you feel two buzzes, you have gone into contracted mode and I have no idea what the initial problem was.
 
 ### The commands simply don't match this reference, including typing simple characters

 You might have accidently swapped the braille dots/keys.
 That is, you were in the Hable menu (held down 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) then held down 1,3,4, 6.
 It seems unlikely to have done that accidently, but when you're messing around trying to learn, it can happen.
 The command to swap braille keys/dots is a toggle.
 Try the above again and see if it's better.

 You can check the braille key/dot settings by pressing the 1 key in a text editing field.
 If you get an 'a', the dots/keys are in standard configuration.
 If you don't get an 'a', they are probably swapped.
 Try pressing the 3 key.
 If that results in an 'a', cells are swapped.
